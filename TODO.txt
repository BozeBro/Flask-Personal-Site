1. Convert routes.py into a blueprint
2. Fix up admin so you don't have to do certain tasks in a weird order
    No (Make app, make models, add models)
    Yes (Make app, make models, init_models, so you can add views right after importation)
3. Change package structure so it is less thick than it is right now. Bloated
    Consider making every file into a package and import from that
4. WTF is gunicorn and NGinX?
